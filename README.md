### Me, It's all about me.

Hi there 👋  My name is Imani Moody, lovely to meet you!

😄 Pronouns: she/they

🔭 I’m currently working on The Connect, which is a web application for users to write reviews for black-owned businesses.

🌱 I’m currently learning back-end development, specifically Mongoose, MongoDB, Node.js and Express. After graduating from CodeSquad, I will be learning more about React and Python. 

🤔 I’m looking for help with how to start a freelancing web developing business. 

🍰 Fun fact: I am a baker. I have a major sweet tooth, so it makes sense.
